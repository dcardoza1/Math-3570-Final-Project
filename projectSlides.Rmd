## What is gganimate?
- Extension package used with ggplot2  
  
- Used to make animations using ggplots  
  - Can also save rendered plots as gifs  

```{r out.width = "200%",out.height = "60%",echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#Image of slide 1
knitr::include_graphics("gganim_plot0099.png")
```

## Why use gganimate?  
- Offers simple and easy to implement functions for adding animations
- Can improve visualization of change in data
- Adds to presentation of data
```{r out.width = "100%",out.height = "100%",echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#Image of slide 1
knitr::include_graphics("./images/data-science-communicate.png")
```


## gganimate Basics & Examples
- gganimate is primarily applied to ggplot objects by specifying transitions to use  
- There are 4 primary transition functions that will be covered:  
  - transition_time()  
  - transition_reveal()  
  - transition_filter()  
  - transition_states()

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

## Transition States
- transition_states() is useful for non-time related transitions between data
- Also can make use of other fields or options to improve animation

```{r cho=FALSE,out.width="50%",out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("drug_labs_end.gif")

```
